            <h3>High Tatras an underrated Hiking GEM of Slovakia</h3>
            <p>
              The mountains that you‚Äôve likely never heard of. They are a part
              of the the northern edge of Slovakia and southern border of Poland
              in Europe. They are the most elevated section of the Tatra chain
              within the Carpathian Mountains and form a natural border between
              the two countries. The area is popular with outdoor enthusiasts.
              Depending on the season, people come and visit for skiing,
              climbing and hiking. üéí

                    I consider it to be one of the easiest and most enjoyable
                    daytime adventures a person could go and experience. Fresh
                    air and beautiful views all around !

                  <p>
                    Highly visited all year-round "Skalnat√° dolina" thanks to
                    the hiking trails and connections of transport. The most
                    interesting attraction for tourists is the cable car to
                    Lomnick√Ω peak.

                  <h5>What I like about it :</h5>
                  <p>
                    The cable car transport is fun to experience which is why
                    many people do. It's like a classic thing to make sure you
                    do it when you get the chance.

                    It's a climb of about a thousand meters with spectacular
                    views from the top. Demanding high-mountain tour. The ascent
                    to K√¥provsk√Ω ≈°t√≠t peak alone is demanding but technically
                    simple.

                  <p>
                    It was a challenge to go and do it myself but that feeling
                    after you accomplish something difficult is unbelievable and
                    double standing on top of a peak. I hated and at the same
                    time liked seeing how much can one push himself and make it.
